# Face-and-Eye-Detection-using-OpenCV
This Python script performs real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV. It captures video from the webcam, detects faces and eyes, and displays rectangles around the detected regions. Enjoy experimenting with computer vision in Python! üêçüöÄ

This script utilizes the OpenCV library to perform real-time face and eye detection through a webcam feed. The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and haarcascade_eye.xml classifiers are loaded to identify faces and eyes in the video frames.

- Install OpenCV library if not already installed:
  ```
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

To use this code as a repository in your GitHub, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git`
2. Make sure to have a webcam connected to your system.
3. Run the script and see the magic happen! The webcam feed will show rectangles around detected faces (orange) and eyes (red). The output will also be saved as 'faceEyeDetection.mp4' in the current directory.

Feel free to customize the code or integrate it into your own projects. Don't forget to give credits to the original repository if you find this code useful!
